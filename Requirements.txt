Requirements to run OSPEX software

Tools: Python 3.6

To run:
Linux, Mac, Windows: You should call main script from command line: python3 filename.py
 
If you don’t have Python library on your local PC and want to test the software:

1. Go to the directory
2. Launch the executable file filename.exe

If you want to work from command line:

1. Go  to the directory where your program is located:
cd directory location

2. Call Python:
python3

3. Upload file content from the script plotting.py:
from plotting import *

4. Choose desired file(s). You can find the data to test in the Data folder:
File = Input(“filename.fits”)

Now you have the access to all parameters and functions of the .fits file

5. Some examples:
a) to load the parameter RATE from DATA:

File.rate

b) to plot Spectrum for Flux:

File.plot_spectrum_flux()

And etc.

Good luck!

Let us remind you that this software is an internship project and will be improved and complemented
